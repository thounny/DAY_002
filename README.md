# DAY_002: Gradient Tunnel Animation

This project is part of my **Daily Code Challenge**, where I practice coding every day by working on a small project. This project features a 3D tunnel animation with a gradient effect that transitions from white in the center to pastel colors at the edges. It also includes smooth scrolling interactions with **GSAP** and **Three.js**.

## Inspiration

The shader effect used in this project was inspired by a shader from **Shadertoy**: [https://www.shadertoy.com/view/MstGWH](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/MstGWH)

## Features

- **3D Tunnel Effect**: Created with a custom shader that generates a dynamic gradient effect.
- **Gradient Animation**: The center of the tunnel is white, and it smoothly transitions into pastel colors as you move toward the edges.
- **Smooth Scrolling**: Integrated smooth scroll behavior using **Lenis** and **GSAP ScrollTrigger**.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**
- **CSS**
- **JavaScript**
- **Three.js**: For rendering the 3D scene and managing the shader materials.
- **GSAP**: For smooth animations and scroll interactions.
- **Lenis**: For smooth scroll experience.
